# Ruby-ROT13-Challenge
A ruby ROT13 algorithm implementation

# Whats is ROT13
ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places") is just a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. Question mark, exclamation mark, comma, spaces, etc won't be affected.

For example, in the following joke the second line was obscured by ROT13:


  Why did the chicken cross the road?
  Gb trg gb gur bgure fvqr!

Transforming the entire text via ROT13 form, the answer to the joke is revealed:

  Jul qvq gur puvpxra pebff gur ebnq?
  To get to the other side!
